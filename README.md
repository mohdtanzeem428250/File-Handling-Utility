# Task Description: File Handling Utility in Java

The objective of my task was to build a File Handling Utility using Java that performs the most basic and essential file operations: creating, reading, writing, appending, and deleting files. This utility was designed to be run in the command line, providing a simple and interactive user interface. Each operation is implemented using Javaâ€™s built-in file handling classes, including File, FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, and the File class for deleting files.
